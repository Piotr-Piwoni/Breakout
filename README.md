Work Done
- Fixed implicated conversion(float, doable) warning in PowerupBase.cpp.
- Implemented a screen shake effect on lose of life.
- Implemented a progress bar for the powerup duration replacing the countdown.
- Implemented mouse-based paddle movement.
- Implemented toggling of the mouse-based paddle movement through the 'M' key.
- Added a "handleInput()" to the GameManager class.
- Implemented a SoundManager for playing audio clips.
- Turned the SoundManager into a singleton.
- Added sounds effects into the game, different ball hit sounds depending on if it's hitting the bricks or something else, a hurt sound for when the player looses a life, and a sound for when a level is completed.
